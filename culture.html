          Dr. Sonya Lopez (she/her/hers) identifies as a Mexican American cis female. She was a first-generation college student and earned her Bachelor’s (2007), Master’s (2008), and Doctoral degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering specializing in Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering from UCLA. Dr. Lopez is an Associate Professor at California State University, Los Angeles, within the Civil Engineering Department. She serves as the Principal advisor for the Department and leads the College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Technology’s Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and Advising Councils. Her research areas include developing methods to ascertain climate variability's impacts on the long-term surface and subsurface water, water storage, ecosystems, wildfires, and water quality using novel modeling techniques and integrating advanced observation data. This work involves modeling studies to include local, sustainable technologies using both physically-based and conceptually-based hydrologic models.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Thus far, she has received over 10 million computing hours, over $1 million as PI, and $10 million as Co-PI in research funding; she has presented at conferences within the United States and Internationally. She has successfully advised nine graduate, and fourteen undergraduate researchers, where 30% were women and 75% were underrepresented minorities. All graduated researchers were either successfully accepted into MS and Ph.D. programs or were offered full-time engineering appointments at government agencies and private-industry companies.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Her long-term goals are to broaden the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM through engagement in research and mentorship.
